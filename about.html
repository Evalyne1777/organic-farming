    <h1> About us</h1>
    <p>
        We are joint farmers from various sections of the country whose aim is to acquire best farm products using very
        simple methods.
        Our project started in the year 2019 where we were initially practising animal husbandry particularly bee keeping.
        <br>
    
    
        We went further and adopted pomoculture from one of the pioneer from Israel but due to financial constrains we
        abandoned it.
        The idea of horticulture emerged at the beggining of 2018 January when in our area there was drought thus the cost
        of vegetables appreciated
        immensly.
        <br>
    
        Now we mostly practice horticulture which entails growing of vegetables and flowers on which cabbages is in plenty
        due to its demand.
        we absolutely practice organic farming whereby we make our own compost manure and also use farmyard.In conrolling
        pests,we use some insects
        like lady birds for alphids amongest others.
        <br>
    
        We acquire skills from some Israel pioneers.The profit from our products is very high thus i encourage all to cope
        us.
        Those who are interested our office is in Nakuru town opposite the main market.
